Newblog
=======

Newblog module is a reimplementation of Drupal's core blog module with some additional features.

* Group blog taxonomy vocabulary for blogs aggregating posts from many users.
* Block for user blogs to show terms grouped by vocabulary from that user's posts. (i.e. non-cloudy tag clouds).
* Context (2.x) condition for blog posts.
* FeedAPI support to import nodes as blog posts.
* Block to display create content links.

* [Semantic Views](http://drupal.org/project/semanticviews)
* [Token](http://drupal.org/project/token)

Roadmap
-------

This module hasn't been actively developed for some time, but it could use some attention:

* Context 3.x support
* Flag 2.x support (to replace custom newblog SQL table and blog property on node objects)
